<h1 class="title">Bitcoin Wallet Cost Function Analysis</h1>
<div class="abstract" id="org29e5523">
<p>
This repository proposes a framework for studying cost functions for the
decision space available to Bitcoin wallets when creating transactions. A
primary goal is accounting for user defined liabilities incurred by transactions
lacking the desired level of privacy or confidentiality, and their interaction
with confirmation times. This is in addition to well established objective
metrics such as the blockspace or fees required for a transaction, which are
taken for granted.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The Bitcoin blockchain is an ordered list of <i>transactions</i> grouped into
individual <i>blocks</i> connected in a linked list structure. Transactions consume
coins in order to create other coins, allowing value to be transferred in an
indivisible unit (satoshis, or <i>sats</i>). A loose definition of a <i>wallet</i> that we
will use is some collection of unspent coins at a point in time. Coins must be
spent completely and only once, so transactions which are otherwise valid will
conflict with each other if they attempt to spend the same coin. In the event of
such double spending, <i>confirmation</i> (inclusion in a block) provides a tie
breaking mechanism. A confirmed transaction renders any conflicting transactions
invalid. Every additional block mined on top of a block including a transaction
is an additional confirmation for that transaction. Agreeing on blocks allows
all validating nodes on the Bitcoin network to agree about exactly which
transactions have or haven't taken effect, maintaining consensus regarding the
state of all sats in circulation by verifying their history.
</p>

<p>
Transactions are unconfirmed when initially broadcast. Nodes on the network will
relay valid transactions to their neighbors using a peer to peer gossip
protocol. A validating node will keep unconfirmed transactions in its <i>mempool</i>,
which can be thought of as a queue. Although the contents is only roughly
synchronized across the network, and with potentially varying rules regarding
acceptance and replacement of transactions, so there is no consensus at the
mempool layer, often "the" mempool is referred to as though there is, because in
practice most nodes do see the same transaction. When a transaction enters the
mempool of a miner<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> they may choose to include
it in their attempts to find the next block, thereby confirming it.
</p>

<p>
When a miner successfully mines a block containing a transaction they may
collect any <i>fees</i> paid by the transaction. These fees are claimed in an output
of the block's <i>coinbase</i> transaction, a special transaction which does not
spend any coins, and instead is funded by the block rewards<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. Block space is limited, so profit
maximizing miners care more about the <i>feerate</i>, than the absolute fee amount,
because all transactions come in a variety of sizes. Therefore, transactions can
be said to be competing over blockspace, and miners are competing over block
rewards. Although the typical mempool behavior is to reject conflicting
transactions, some nodes allow transaction replacement by fees regardless, and
transactions may also opt in to being replaceable according to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki">BIP 125</a>.
</p>

<p>
Confirmation is not guaranteed to be final, but the cost of confirming a
conflicting transaction in a competing block compounds as the depth of the
confirming block increases with newly found blocks. This reduces the likelihood
of a transaction being reversed. A transaction might be considered final by any
of its beneficiaries when the cost to mine a competing blockchain that undoes
the transaction exceeds any payoff the sender might collect from doing so.
However, a transaction need not be considered final in order to spend its
outputs, and miners can confirm sequences of dependent transactions in a single
block in order to maximize their rewards.

<h3 id="orgfacfd16"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Utility of Transacting with Bitcoin</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Regardless of how it's configured or how it works, every wallet ends up making
decisions on behalf of the user, favoring certain actions over others. This is
an optimization problem by definition. This implies the existence of a cost
function even if one is not explicitly written down, as code or in any other
form.
</p>

<p>
Transactions have costs associated with them, and compete for limited blockspace
with other transactions. Therefore, we must assume that transforming the set of
coins provides positive utility from their signers' perspective and that they
expect confirmation within a reasonable time frame. If that wasn't the case they
wouldn't authorize the transaction. It is the role of cost functions to model
this utility.
</p>

<p>
For example, economic exchange can be mediated by transferring control over
sats, and typically requires more timely confirmation with higher feerates.
Other reasons one might choose to broadcast a transaction include key management
(in particular with regards to cold storage), or when enforcing some outcome
defined by an offchain protocol (e.g. unilateral closure of a Lightning channel
and the possible punishment transactions that may follow). In a perfect world we
would not have to worry about these details, but they do need to be taken into
account in some cases because of technical constraints or for reasons of
security, privacy and mechanism design or incentives. Perhaps most prominently,
inputs and outputs of different types vary in their size requirements, which
given the user's chosen feerate determines the total fees paid, and the main
parameter controlling confirmation times vs. cost. The total fees paid are an
obvious term included in any cost function. In order to control the wallet's
behavior additional terms are needed in order to internalize any positive and
negative externalities of the transaction from the point of view of the user.
</p>

<p>
Clearly defined cost functions can benefit users in several ways. Wallet
software should provide knobs as appropriate for the intended use cases in order
to allow the users' preferences to be satisfied simply and intuitively, because
users rely on this software to realize their indirect goals, as assumed above.
Secondly, claims made by wallet vendors, especially those specializing in
privacy, might be examined more closely from this perspective. Being rigorous
requires a more objective basis for comparison between different described or
observed behaviors and performance with respect desired behavior. Formulating
these claims in terms of mathematical optimization can help to scrutinize both
the claims and the corresponding code about which the claims are made, as well
as provide more precise definitions of the desired behavior.

<div id="outline-container-orgd60c38b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd60c38b"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Transaction Structure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

<div id="org44135af" class="figure">
<p><img src="diagrams/examples/basic_transactions.svg" alt="basic_transactions.svg" class="org-svg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>A simplified illustration of two (somewhat contrived) transactions illustrated using Graphviz. Within each transaction coins appear as inputs on the left column and as outputs on the right, represented by their nominal values. The same coin may appear twice when it has been spent, in which case an arrow connects from the output that created it to the input that spent it. A heavy border highlights unspent outputs. The previous outputs of the first transaction are not displayed.</p>
</div>

<p>
As a first approximation, Bitcoin transactions consist of two lists, one of
<i>inputs</i> and one of <i>outputs</i>. Inputs fund a transaction, spending the outputs
of prior transactions by reference, accompanied with proof that the transaction
is authorized. The number of sats allocated to each output is specified in its
value. Transactions which are not fully funded aren't valid. Transaction are
identified by their <i>txid</i>, derived by hashing them. Inputs refer to previous
outputs by using a <code>txid</code> and an index specifying the output being spent.
</p>

<p>
The transaction graph is the overall structure formed by transactions being
interconnected. Because the full graph is publicly known, every coin has a
history comprising of its funding transaction. That transaction is of course
funded by other coins, the transactions that created them were in turn funded by
others still, and so on. Similarly, one can talk about all of the transactions
that follow a certain coin or a certain transaction, to some depth.
</p>

<p>
Transaction fees are paid by making the sum of the output values in a
transaction smaller than the implied sum of the input values (this is calculated
from values of the <i>previous outputs</i>). Although no fees are required for a
transaction to be valid nodes can specify a minimum feerate for transactions
relayed to them in order to avoid clogging their mempools.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In addition to what was already mentioned, the data of a transaction consists of
output scripts, and signature or witness data<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> which
proves authorization for each input, a version field and a locktime field. The
space requirement for this data is accounted for using <i>weight units</i>. This can
divide the total fees paid by a transaction to calculate a feerate in sats per
weight unit, but more commonly fees are given in sats per (kilo) <i>virtual
byte</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Before a transaction is fully constructed its feerate is generally not known
even if its input and output lists are finalized because the final weight of
inputs may vary.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> The actual sizes are typically within a few weight units of the
worst case values. Accounting for the worst case a minimum feerate can be
guaranteed, with the effective feerate for the input typically overshooting it
by a negligible amount. The shared overhead (up to a few dozen weight units) in
a transaction must also be taken into account in order to ensure a minimum
feerate for the transaction as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The effective value of inputs and effective cost of outputs can be defined as
the associated nominal values adjusted by some fee amount. For inputs the fees
are subtracted from the previous outputs' nominal values, and for outputs the
fee amount is added to the nominal value. For each input and output, given a
feerate<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>, the adjustment can be derived from the weight, and given an
adjustment a feerate can be derived from the weight.
</p>

<p>
Since a wallet belonging to a user will typically not have a coin or combination
of coins of exactly the right amount in order to make a payment of arbitrary
value, transactions often send some of the input funds back to the owner of the
transaction. These are known as <i>change</i> outputs, or more generally <i>self-spend</i>
outputs.
</p>

<h3 id="org9fa738f"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Privacy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Due to its transparency, transacting with Bitcoin privately is hardly straight
forward. The transactions themselves reveal information about the amounts as
already noted, but the wallet software being used might be possible to infer as
well, because different wallets produce different observable patterns in their
script types, the ordering of inputs or outputs, choice of feerates, locktime,
and so on. These patterns are called <i>transaction fingerprints</i>. The transaction
graph is also used to heuristically clustering coins together, allowing the
associations with exogenous information to be propagated to other coins. Of
particular concern, coins or transactions are often linked to personally
identifying information provided to exchanges or merchants. This information may
leak if the websites are breached, exposing users to risk potentially years
after they've forgotten the details of their activity.
</p>

<p>
Other information may also be taken into account: temporal patterns, or where a
transaction originated from (from which node on the network, and potentially
network related information that can also be linked to personally identifying
information).
</p>

<p>
At the level of the blockchain Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system: public keys are
unique identifiers that are overtly implicated in transactions. A single user
may use any number of them and most wallet software will do so by default, in
order to avoid reuse. When used more than once, for example because of a static
donation address, the coins in question clearly belong to the same user. Two
common heuristics initially described in the Bitcoin white paper and which have
since been studied extensively are often used to interpret the transaction
graph. The first heuristic assumes that inputs to a single transaction belong to
the same owner. The second is nebulous, and is more of a family heuristics for
identifying the change output in a payment transaction, thereby ascribing
ownership to it as well.
</p>

<p>
Because inadvertently revealing financial information risks the safety and the
financial interests of users, and because it is relatively straight forward to
selectively disclose information, we will assume that the need for privacy is
self evident. It follows the lack of widespread use is due to technical
barriers, lack of education, and market failure, among other reasons. In other
words, a vast majority of users would benefit from resistance to dragnet
surveillance by nation level adversaries, as well as confidentiality from
counterparties which may present a concern for targeted attacks. The threat of a
targeted attack by a nation level adversary is more serious and likely imposes
unreasonable costs for more users, but this too should be considered because
usage of privacy technology is positive sum.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the user's threat model, different tools may be employed with
varying costs and delays required in order to afford users the ability to
transact privately under some adverserial assumptions. The goal of this study is
to better understand the tradeoffs which are available or possible and
facilitate comparative analysis.

in the <code>txid</code> hash, as indicated by the name Segregated Witness. This allows
transactions that <b>only</b> contain SegWit inputs to have a known <code>txid</code> before
they are signed. Knowing the <code>txid</code> in advance makes it possible to prepare and
sign dependent transactions ahead of time, before authorizing a whole set of
possible outcomes with the final signature on the initial transaction.</p></div></div>

final feerate, because the overhead of the data shared by all inputs and outputs
must also be taken into account, and because some input types' weight is not
constant.</p></div></div>
