This repository proposes a framework for studying cost functions for the
decision space available to Bitcoin wallets when creating transactions. A
primary goal is accounting for user defined liabilities incurred by transactions
lacking the desired level of privacy or confidentiality, and their interaction
with confirmation times. This is in addition to well established objective
metrics such as the blockspace or fees required for a transaction, which are
taken for granted.
